Welcome to Brian's Baseball Hall of Fame Voting App!!

This app will be used to prove that the baseball writers put in charge of HOF voting are terrible at their jobs.

Functionality:

The app contains a list of baseball cards- each pertaining to a retired baseball player.

Each card is equipped with a like button immediately adjascent to a number of likes.

A user can like any or all players, voting them into the hall of fame (Some players are already in the HOF. In this case you are voting if the writers got it right).

A user can also input information on a player that they wish to be included in the voting.
 
 -Simply fill out the form on the top of the page with information about the player, including a name, picture and a few career stats.
 
 -The player will be posted to the API and begin acruing votes starting at 0.

User Interface:

When the user first opens the website, they will be alerted to the functionality with this message.
